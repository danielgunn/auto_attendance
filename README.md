# Automatic Attendance Taker for Engage Server
* As a teacher who is more focussed on teaching the lesson than taking attendance, I often forget to do so.
* As an employee who doesnt want to get in trouble, its best that there is some script that puts the damn attendance into the webform.
* Now there is such a script!

# Support
