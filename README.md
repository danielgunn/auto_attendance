# auto_attendance
As a teacher, I'm responsible for taking attendance at every class.  As a not very good teacher, I seldom do take attendance.  As an employee who doesnt want to get in trouble, its best that there is some script that puts the damn attendance into the webform.  Now there is such a script!

# How does it work
Well first off, its only for teachers at my specific school.  If you dont teach at King's College Hangzhou in China, then this script is not for you

# How to use
Again, probably you wont!

# Why is it here
To help those who want to see how selenium web drivers work in conjunction with python scripts.  If you dont understand wtf those things are then go away
